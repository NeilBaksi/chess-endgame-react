### Comments
With the current implementation it is very easy to add the remaining pieces into the game logic. Given how all the objects work, making a fully function chess game - adhering to rules and not allowing for suicide, is simply some extra algortihmic code that can be added without changing any of the existing code. 

I stuck to completing everthing that was needed instead of making it fancy, I hope that is okay.
